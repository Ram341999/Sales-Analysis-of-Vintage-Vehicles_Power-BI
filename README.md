# Sales Analysis of Vintage Vehicles

In this project, I utilized Power BI to analyze and visualize sales data for vintage vehicles globally. The dataset included detailed information on various aspects such as product names, customer demographics, and sales metrics.

## Introduction:
Data acquisition and analysis are crucial for businesses, providing insights through visualization. Translating information into visual formats like maps and graphs helps our brains understand and extract insights more easily. In this project, we delve into the sales data of vintage vehicles, aiming to uncover trends, patterns, and key insights.
<br>
The vintage vehicle market has seen significant activity recently, making it an exciting area for analysis. This project focuses on a comprehensive dataset to visualize sales metrics, customer demographics, and geographical trends. Our primary goal is to understand sales dynamics and identify factors influencing performance.
<br>
<br>
In today's data-driven world, visualizing sales data can significantly impact decision-making processes, helping businesses optimize strategies and improve outcomes. This project demonstrates the power of data visualization in understanding and leveraging sales trends.
<br>

## Methodology:
<br>
The dataset includes detailed sales information such as product names, order details, customer demographics, and geographical data. Key variables used in the analysis include:
Product Information: Product name and product line.
Customer Demographics: Customer name and country.
Geographical Data: Sales office location and customer country.
Data cleaning and preparation were conducted to ensure accuracy and relevance. Power BI was used to create interactive visualizations, allowing for deep dives into the data from multiple perspectives.

## DAX Queries:
Several DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) queries were used to compute key metrics and create the visualizations:

1.	Avg Sales value per order = sum('Sales Data for Power BI'[sales_value])/(DISTINCTCOUNT('Sales Data for Power BI'[ordernumber]))
2.	Net profit = sum('Sales Data for Power BI'[sales_value])-sum('Sales Data for Power BI'[cost_of_sales])
3.	Selected Metric = SWITCH(SELECTEDVALUE('Table'[NumberId]),1,SUM('Sales Data for Power BI'[sales_value]) ,2,(SUM('Sales Data for Power BI'[sales_value])-SUM('Sales Data for Power BI'[cost_of_sales])) ,SUM('Sales Data for Power BI'[sales_value]))
